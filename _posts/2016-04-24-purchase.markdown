These are the things I borrowed & bought:

* the Raspberry Pi 3 (Model B) itself + case
* the official power supply (as needs to be 5V and 2.5A)
* a *micro* SD card to hold the operating system (my old Pi 2 takes standard SD cards)
* a microSD to SD card adapter (so I can access the card from my mac)

### Inputs
I already have USB keyboard & mouse lying around so will reuse those.
The Pi comes with wifi on board, but theres also an ethernet port.

### Display
I've got a 19" LCD that will do 1280x1024, the inputs are DVI and VGA. 
The Pi has a full size HDMI port so I got a HDMI (male) to DVI (female) adapter so I can attach my existing DVI cable to the Pi
